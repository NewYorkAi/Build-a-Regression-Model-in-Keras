    "This notebook builds upon Part B by using a neural network model that includes three hidden layers, each with 10 nodes and utilizing the ReLU activation function. The data used for training will be normalized, and the objective is to observe the impact of increasing the number of hidden layers on the model's performance, specifically in terms of the mean squared errors (MSEs)."
